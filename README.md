# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
This hand gesture recognition project uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks and control media playback and volume using gestures. It integrates OpenCV, VLC, and Pycaw for real-time video processing, media control, and system volume adjustment.

Hand Gesture Recognition for Media Control
 Control media playback and volume using hand gestures with OpenCV & MediaPipe

Overview
This project uses MediaPipe for real-time hand gesture recognition, allowing users to:
 Play/Pause a media file using hand gestures
 Adjust system volume by changing finger distance

Technologies Used
1,Python
2.OpenCV (for image processing)
3.MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
4.VLC (python-vlc) (for media playback)
5.Pycaw (for volume control)

How It Works
 Hand detection is performed using MediaPipe Hands
 Thumb & Pinky Finger control play/pause actions
 Thumb & Index Finger adjust system volume
 Real-time feedback is displayed via OpenCV

Controls
Gesture	Action
Wrist to Middle Finger Distance ⬆️	Play Video 🎬
Wrist to Middle Finger Distance ⬇️	Pause Video ⏸
Thumb to Index Distance ⬆️	Increase Volume 🔊
Thumb to Index Distance ⬇️	Decrease Volume 🔉
